          ## Test with a `minimal.lua` file
          > [!IMPORTANT]
          > This allows me to _recreate_ your issue on my machine. Please don't skip this step and please provide the full `minimal.lua` file

          Firstly, test and run Neovim with the minimal config below. Be sure to add your Persisted.nvim config, saving to a `minimal.lua` file and adding any additional plugins you may need.
          ```lua
          local root = "/tmp/persisted"

          -- Set stdpaths to use root dir
          for _, name in ipairs({ "config", "data", "state", "cache" }) do
            vim.env[("XDG_%s_HOME"):format(name:upper())] = root .. "/" .. name
          end

          -- Bootstrap lazy
          local lazypath = root .. "/plugins/lazy.nvim"
          if not vim.loop.fs_stat(lazypath) then
            vim.fn.system({
              "git",
              "clone",
              "--filter=blob:none",
              "--single-branch",
              "https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git",
              lazypath,
            })
          end
          vim.opt.runtimepath:prepend(lazypath)

          vim.opt.sessionoptions = "buffers,curdir,folds,globals,tabpages,winpos,winsize" -- Session options to store in the session

          -- Install plugins
          local plugins = {
            {
              "olimorris/persisted.nvim",
              opts = {
                -- Your custom config here
              }
            },
            -- Put any other plugins here
          }
          require("lazy").setup(plugins, {
            root = root .. "/plugins",
          })
          ```

          Once you've updated for your config, run Neovim with this command:
          ```sh
          nvim --clean -u minimal.lua
          ```

          Open some buffers and save the session with:
          ```sh
          :SessionSave
          ```

          Then re-open neovim and load the session with:
          ```sh
          :SessionLoad
          ```
