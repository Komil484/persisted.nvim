# Contributing

If you open a PR please consider the following:

- If you're adding new functionality, please open an issue to discuss the design of the new feature
- How the end user will consume your new feature. It's often easier to start with the API and work backwards
- Consider the use of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to make your commit messages more descriptive
- Add new tests to the plugin (use the existing ones as a template)

The mantra for this plugin is "simple session management" and as such the code base is relatively simple. Please consider this in your code.
